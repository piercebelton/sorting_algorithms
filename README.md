# Sorting Algorithms

**Designed to benchmark a couple common sorting algorithms using ruby.**

To try it out, either clone the repo and run the following bash command:

`$ ruby sort.rb`

Or simply run `irb` from terminal and copy paste the contents of `sort.rb` into the terminal. You are of course welcome to alter the array sizes, but beware: a 100,000 size array took my laptop over 13 minutes to bubble sort. Comparatively, a merge sort of the same array took 343 milliseconds.
